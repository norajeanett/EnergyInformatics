    Solve the linear programming problem for scheduling appliance usage to minimize electricity costs.

    Objective:
    MINIMIZE: sum_{h=1..24} price[h] * sum_{a} x_{a,h}
    This objective calculates the total electricity cost across all appliances and hours.

    Subject to constraints:
    - sum_{h} x_{a,h} = E_a for each appliance a.
      Each appliance must consume its total required energy 'E' over the scheduled hours.
      
    - x_{a,h} = 0 if the hour 'h' is not within the operating intervals for appliance a.
      Appliances must have zero consumption outside their designated operational intervals.

    - x_{a,h} in [pmin_a, pmax_a] if hour 'h' is within the intervals for appliance a.
      Applies minimum and maximum power bounds during valid intervals for each appliance.

    Parameters:
    - prices (dict): A dictionary where keys are hour indices (1-24) and values are electricity prices in NOK/kWh.
    - appliances_dict (dict): A dictionary containing appliance data. Each key is the appliance name, and the value is another dictionary with:
      - 'E' (float): Total energy requirement (kWh) for the appliance.
